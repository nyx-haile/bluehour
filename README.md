Bluehour is a decentralized film & TV production studio for diverse stories and diverse story tellers. The internet first platform connects creators, investors, and enthusiasts in one digital ecosystem. Creators submit projects for funding and users vote on, fund and greenlight the projects that most resonate with them. Bluehour is different from current funding solutions because we trust and empower audiences instead of Hollywood executives to make critical funding decisions.
